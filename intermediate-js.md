# Intermediate Javascript Assessments

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

.map() performs an action on each element inside of an array.

.filter() checks each element inside an array against a condition and returns a new array with the elements that pass the condition.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

Object destructuring helps to keep code DRY by placing an object's keys into an easy to use variable, thus reducing excessive dot notation.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

Primarily, scope.

Var is scoped to an entire function whereas let is scoped to a specific block of code. Const is similar to let except that const cannot be reassigned a new value.

4. Why is testing important?

Testing is important for a number of reasons. Testing can be used to break your deliverable into smaller pieces. Doing so allows one to focus on a single feature at a time and not allow scope creep to take over. It's useful for correctly defining your deliverable and in essence, architecting what you're trying to program.

Testing can also save teams time by preventing issues from happening in the first place. Another benefit is that features added in the future can be checked to ensure that past features are not adversely impacted.

5. What is a higher order function?

A higher order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns another function.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is a data type that contains key value pairs and methods, essentially, data and behavior.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

I learned what makes pair programming work and not work, how to think about state and props in React, and how to organize components in different layers.

Using the <link> tag in the head of the html document.

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

Front end development focus on developing the client facing side of applications.

The basic tech stack is html, css, and JavaScript. Frameworks are also utilized, the most popular currently being React.

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

Block scope refers to how a variable within a block of code is scoped to that particular block (e.g. what's inside the curly brackets) and is not accessible outside of that block.

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

Inheritance is the idea of passing a class's common properties and methods to its children, who all share the class's common properties and methods but who may each have their own unique properties and methods as well.
